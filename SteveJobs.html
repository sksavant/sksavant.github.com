<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Steve Jobs was a visionary. Jobs went to Reed college after his high school. He returned to California in 1974. He, along with Wozniak build the Apple I.</p>

<h2>Steve Jobs Speech</h2>

<p>I did not graduate from college. This is as close as I can get to a college graduation. I will tell three stories.</p>

<h2>First Story : Connecting the Dots</h2>

<p>I dropped out of Reed college after first 6 months.
My parents promised I would go to college. I naively choose college that is as expensive as Stanford. I had no idea what I was wanted to do in my life and no idea how college would help me figure it out. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out okay. Looking back it was the one of the best decisions I made. I would walk 7 miles to get one good meal at the Hari Krishna temple. I learned caligraphy. Mac was the first computer with beautiful typography. Ofcourse it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college but it was very very clear 10 years after, looking backwards. You cannot connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them backwards. You have to trust that the dots will somehow connect themselves in future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, karma, whatever because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even if it leads to off the well worn path and that will make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Second Story : Love and Loss</h2>

<p>I found what I loved to do early in life. ... then I got fired. I really did not know what to do with my life for 6 months. Something slowly began to dawn on me. I still loved what I did. So I decided to start over. It turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that would happen to me. I founded Next, Pixar. Apple bought Pixar. Sometimes life is gonna hit you in the head with a brick, do not lose faith. Find the thing you love to do. Keep looking, Dont settle.</p>

<h2>Third Story : Death</h2>

<p>If you live each day as if it were it was your last, some day you will most certainly be right. I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I'm about to do today"?.
Remembering that we will all be dead soon is the most important tool to help me make the big choices in life. Because all external expectations, pride, fear of embarassment, fall away in the face of death. Remembering you are going to die is the best way to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose . You are already naked you have no not to follow your heart. Death was a useful but purely intellectual context. No one wants to die. Death is the destination we all share. Your time is limited. So dont live someone elses life. Dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking. Dont let the noise of others opinion drown your inner voice. Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.</p>
